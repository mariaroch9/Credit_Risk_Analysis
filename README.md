# Overview of the analysis:

## Background
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem as good loans outnumber risky loans. Therefore, I’ll be employing different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. 

## Purpose
To apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk. I’ll be using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTEalgorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENNalgorithm. 

Finally, I’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
